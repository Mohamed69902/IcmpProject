# IcmpProject


## I started learning networking libraries in python a week ago this is my first project, it’s a simple one but very important to understand how packets are sent in the network.

## It’s an ICMP packet sender. The program asks for a Source IP and a Destination IP, creates an ICMP packet with this information, and sends it, then prints the echo reply. It also shows the details of the packet and lets you send more if you want.
